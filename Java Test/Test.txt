1. datatype variable = value;

2. No
3. No
4.No
5.The String[] args parameter in the main method of a Java program allows you to pass command-line arguments to the program when it is executed.
6.Yes
7.Yes
8.No
9.int array[] = { "Values"};
	int array = {30,40,50,60,70};
10.Error
11.Write the programe using notpad editor and save it in a .extension formate then compile the programe using command javac filename.java
then it will create bytecode the jvm will convert the bytecode into machine level language using the command java filename then it will give the output.
12.javac is the Java compiler It is a program that translates Java source code into bytecode.
13.The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a runtime exception in Java that occurs when you try to access an array element with an index that is outside the valid range of the array.
   java is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) It is responsible for executing the compiled bytecode produced by the javac compiler.
14.class loader is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that is responsible for dynamically loading Java classes into the JVM at runtime.
15.Java is not considered a pure object-oriented programming language.The reason lies in a few characteristics of Java that deviate from the strict definition of a pure object-oriented language
16.The JDK is a software development kit that provides tools, libraries, and documentation for developing Java application.
   The JRE is an environment that provides the necessary runtime libraries, class libraries, and resources required for executing Java applications 
   JVM is the virtual machine that executes Java bytecode
17.The special method called by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is the main method.
18.Yes
19.Yes
20.No Change
21.Java Virtual Machine(JVM) will convert the bytecode into machine level language
22.There are two main types of class members in Java
  1.Instance Variables: Instance variables  are variables that hold data specific to each instance of a class. 
  2.Methods: Methods are functions defined within a class that perform certain operations or actions.
23.Formal arguments,Actual arguments
25.variable is a named storage location used to hold a value.
26.In Java variables are stored in the computer's memory during program execution
27.Variable initialization refers to the process of giving an initial value to a variable when it is declared. 
   variable assignment occurs when a value is assigned or reassigned to an already declared variable at some point during the program's execution.
28.Memory Allocation: declare a variable in Java  the compiler needs to allocate memory based on its datatype
29.Local variable,Instance variable
30.jvm will convert the bytecode into machine level language
32.Write once run anywhere
33.java --version
34.java SE 17
35.class is a  bluprint or design to create an object
36.object is an Instance of class
37.class Name {
	//Statement
	}
38.class Person{
	String name;
	int age;
	String gender;
	Person(String name,int age,String gender){
	System.out.println(name,age,gender);
}
}
class PersonRunner{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	system.out.println(Person Details);
	 Person refer = new Person();
	Person();
	} 
}
39.constructor is special member function that is used to initialize objects of a class
